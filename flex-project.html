          <p>CIBC Digital hosts a design competition for their interns that runs throughout the term. We were split into four teams of six and each given a unique business problem. Our team was also assigned a sponsor and mentor. We had the whole term to come up with the best and most feasible solution and at the end of term, pitch our idea to a panel of four Digital VPs.</p>
          <p>This is our design solution, At a Glance, which won first place.</p>

          <p>This was the problem presented to us by our sponsor, the Senior Director and Head of Strategy at Simplii Financial. After asking him to elaborate some more on the issue, we were able to understand what he meant by such a broad topic.</p>
          <p> “[Paraphrased] Currently, CIBC does not have a reliable way to collect feedback from its clients. However, feedback is essential to ensure that CIBC is delivering products and services that its clients actually use. We do not want to be wasting resources on products that clients find unnecessary. We instead want to know how to improve our existing services or find opportunities for new ones.”</p>

          <p>We started off by researching the different ways that companies collect feedback. What we found was that most feedback collection methods are generic and unappealing. It was therefore no surprise to us when we learned that only 1 in 4 people respond to online surveys.</p>

          <p>Based on our research, our team noticed a trend towards companies providing personalized options for their customers.</p>
          <p>This was what our mentor said about personalization in banking:</p>
          <p>“[Paraphrased] A lot of banks have personalized data but it is difficult to know how to use this type of information. This is why tackling financial literacy can be such a sensitive topic. We want to help our clients, but we want them to still feel like they are making their own decisions. It is not up to the bank to judge our client’s spending, but perhaps guide them towards making a better choice.”</p>

          <p>Our team wanted to introduce this idea to CIBC, by presenting clients with their financial information in a visual, easy to understand, and colourful format.</p>
          <p>The goal of At a Glance would be to provide clients with engaging information that gives them autonomy to choose what they want to see but ultimately releases the burden of making complex financial decisions.</p>
          <p>In return, clients will answer a quick survey that CIBC can use to collect feedback.</p>
