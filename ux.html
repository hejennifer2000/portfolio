          <h3 class="pt-5 pb-3">BACKGROUND</h3>
          <p>Simplii Financial is CIBC’s direct bank. They are in the process of redesigning their homepage and asked me to get started on this project by completing some preliminary competitive research and creating an initial wireframe and mockup. The redesign would need to consider restructuring their current navigation bar as well as the implementation of their new Content Hub, a page for centralized financial articles and advice.</p>

          <h3 class="pt-5 pb-3">COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
          <p>I started by studying a few of Simplii’s direct banking competitors, including Tangerine, EQ Bank and Canadian Tire Bank. In particular, I recorded homepage design patterns and stories that I felt were successful. This included researching the type of information that is commonly presented on a bank's homepage and the hierarchy at which it is displayed.</p>
          <p>Through this process, I identified two key areas of improvement.</p>

          <p class="pt-2 font-weight-bold">1. The navigation bar</p>
          <p class="pb-3">The navigational structure is too complex for the small handful of products currently available through Simplii.</p>
          <p class="font-weight-bold">2. Benefits</p>
          <p class="pb-3">Simplii does not emphasize the benefits of becoming a client directly on their homepage. Instead, users are directed to a second "Join Simplii" page.</p>

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 offset-md-2">
          <p>There are two problem areas identified in the site's current navigational structure.</p>
          <p>In the first problem, clients going through the navigation bar are immediately overwhelmed with Simplii's products. It is difficult to choose between a fixed and variable rate mortgage if the user does not understand the difference between the two.</p>
          <p>The second problem is that Simplii's Cash Back Visa is their only credit card product. However, the user must click through the navigation bar in an extra, unnecessary step in order to view this card.</p>

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 offset-md-2">
          <p>Simplii currently has higher level product pages that introduce each of its product types. These pages contain an overview of each product type and can be accessed if the user clicks on the "View All" option in the navigation bar. If Simplii changes its site structure by creating a product-based navigation system, these pages can be leveraged to provide the user with a better understanding of each product type. It also presents the opportunity to display information on each of the products, ensuring the user makes an educated decision.</p>

          <p>Currently, Simplii has a separate "Join Simplii" page that details the benefits of becoming a client. Although the current homepage directs the user to this page, Simplii is assuming that clients will not only find this link, but be enticed to click on it. Because Simplii is not presenting benefits directly on their homepage, they are losing the opportunity to immediately attract new clients with reasons to open an account.</p>

          <p>I was not satisfied with this result. I found myself too fixated on what would happen to the "Join Simplii" page if all the information relevant to this page was now relocated onto the homepage. There would be a redundancy of information on Simplii's website and an increased risk of this page becoming obsolete.</p>
          <p>But, an obsolete page can always be deleted. There were more important things to consider such as, what does "Banking Simplii" even mean? A navigation bar should be intuitive to use and although "Banking Simplii" sounds great, it does not represent the type of information a user would find there.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, Simplii does not explicitly state how to become a client, which is disadvantageous if the purpose of Simplii's homepage is to attract new clients.</p>

          <p>In order for a user to obtain Simplii’s products, the user first needs to become a client. To become a client, users must open a chequing or savings account. However, Simplii's homepage does not explicitly state this. Instead, the homepage immediately presents their wide range of products. If a user visits the site with the intention of applying for a mortgage with Simplii, there is a risk that the user will not understand that they must be a client first. At least not until they attempt to apply for the mortgage.</p>

          <p>Upon reflection, if I were to continue with this redesign, I would love to study site analytics to inform my decisions and discover additional areas of improvement. It would be great to work on this project for longer and continue collecting feedback from other designers and users to keep on iterating. Unfortunately, my four month internship came to a close and I am now back in school. However, within the two quick weeks of working on this project, I learned so much about balancing and juggling the needs of business, existing clients, and new site visitors. Thank you to the Simplii team at CIBC digital for giving me the opportunity to start exploring this project for you. </p>
